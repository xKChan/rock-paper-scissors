# rock-paper-scissors

Created a simple game of Rock Paper Scissors.  There were many challenges that I had to overcome in order to finally create the game.
Some other the problems were:
  - User input box was popping up one more times then intended.  Ex) 5 Rounds, it would pop up 6 times instead.
  - being able to call a function within another function > The outcome was not what I was expecting to happen.
  - The original IF statements for a one round game

  These were some of the problems that I encountered throughout this project.

  Overall I learned a lot from making this game such as:
  - The importance of planning out the project first
  - Making pseudocode before even trying to type it
  - Working to long on it and not taking a step back and looking at the projec tin smaller sections

Looking forward to coming back to this project to make it much better later on in the course of The Odin Project.
